Write a function multiplicative_persistence(n) that counts how many steps until a number's digits multiply to a single digit.

n = int(input("Enter a number: ");
count = 0

while n >= 10:
product = 1
for digit in str(n):
product *= int(digit)
n = product
count += 1

print("Multiplicative persistence:",count)
